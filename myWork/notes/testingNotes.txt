General rule of thumb is:
1. Tests should fail fast
2. Tests should fail loud
3. Tests should test something important.

Vitest finds its tests in two ways:
1. By finding the folder named __tests__
2. By finding files with the name filename.test.jsx

Both are the naming conventions accepted by Vitest

npm i -D vitest-fetch-mock@0.3.0 => To mock API requests.

Mocking = for API requests

Snapshot testing:
A low effort, low-confidence method of testing.
It renders a component, and remembers that result.
The next time you render the same component is rendered, if anything changes, 
  then the test fails.

Snapshot testing is okay to use for UI displays, but not for any of the logic that
  happens in the background.

Coverage: What files are tested, what files are not, what lines are tested 
  and what lines are not.
