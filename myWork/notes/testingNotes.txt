General rule of thumb is:
1. Tests should fail fast
2. Tests should fail loud
3. Tests should test something important.

Vitest finds its tests in two ways:
1. By finding the folder named __tests__
2. By finding files with the name filename.test.jsx

Both are the naming conventions accepted by Vitest
