Hooks:
Allows interactivity and side effects in our code.

Note: Try to keep your functions pure, and avoid doing heavy rendering logic in your components.
	Why? React has its own logic to re-render components based on changes it notices.
	If a regularly used component has a lot of logic, it will take more time to render on change.

Anything that starts with use.. is a hook.

Never use Hooks inside conditionals. This would mess up React's rendering order.
Never use inside for, while loops, if conditions and so on.

NOTE: Vite is responsible for the jsx to js translation. So you'll have to build using Vite 
	for your program to work.

Portals:
These allow you to render additional information depending on what is currently being rendered
	on screen. 
	Example: Your main react page would render, and depending on the info there
						you can use a portal to render the respective side bar.

Class Components and Error Boundaries:

We cannot use Hooks with Class Components.

Usually we use uncontrolled forms. This means, let the browser handle all the 
	form details, and we handle the onSubmit() event.

We use uncontrolled forms if the form never changes. For example, sometimes depending
	on the choice a user makes (like country: UAE), we will need to change the form dynamically 
	(city: Abu Dhabi, Dubai) etc. In this case, we use a controlled form.
