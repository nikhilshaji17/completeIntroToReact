Hooks:
Allows interactivity and side effects in our code.

Note: Try to keep your functions pure, and avoid doing heavy rendering logic in your components.
	Why? React has its own logic to re-render components based on changes it notices.
	If a regularly used component has a lot of logic, it will take more time to render on change.

Anything that starts with use.. is a hook.

Never use Hooks inside conditionals. This would mess up React's rendering order.
Never use inside for, while loops, if conditions and so on.

NOTE: Vite is responsible for the jsx to js translation. So you'll have to build using Vite 
	for your program to work.
